# Description
This project showcases a responsive and interactive line chart built with React, Recharts, Framer Motion, and Lucide React icons. The chart visualizes internet speed data over different time ranges, allowing users to switch between views for the last 3 hours, last 24 hours, last 7 days, and last 30 days.

# Features

1. Interactive Line Chart: Displays internet speed (in Mbps) data using Recharts. Users can hover over the chart to see detailed data points and trends.
2. Responsive Design: The chart adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices using ResponsiveContainer from Recharts.
3. Animated Transitions: Utilizes Framer Motion for smooth fade-in and slide-up animations, enhancing the visual appeal when switching between data ranges.
4. Data Filtering: Users can easily filter data by selecting different time ranges (last 3 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days) using buttons that dynamically update the displayed data.
5. Icon Integration: The Lucide React icon library is used to display a network icon next to the chart title, adding a visual cue to the purpose of the chart.
